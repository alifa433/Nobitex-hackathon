# Nobitex NFT Integration for Enhanced User Experience

## Project Overview

The Nobitex NFT Integration project aims to enhance the user experience on the Nobitex platform by introducing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These NFTs can be used to incentivize users and offer reduced trading fees. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Features

- **NFT Creation**: Users can mint NFTs to represent unique badges or privileges.
- **NFT Integration**: NFTs are seamlessly integrated into the Nobitex platform.
- **Reduced Fees**: Holders of specific NFTs enjoy reduced trading fees.
- **User Onboarding**: Users can claim initial NFTs upon registration.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Ethereum Deployment

3. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network.
4. Integrate the Ethereum smart contract with the Nobitex platform.
5. Customize the frontend to display user-owned Ethereum NFTs.

### Binance Smart Chain Deployment

6. Deploy the smart contract to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network.
7. Integrate the BSC smart contract with the Nobitex platform.
8. Customize the frontend to display user-owned BSC NFTs.

## Smart Contract

- The `NFT.sol` file contains the Solidity smart contract for creating and managing NFTs.
- Deploy this contract to both the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks.
- Mint NFTs for users to distribute badges or privileges.

## Frontend

- The frontend folder contains user interface code for displaying user-owned NFTs from both Ethereum and BSC.
- Integrate the frontend with the Nobitex platform.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for users and developers can be found in the `documentation` folder. It includes:

- How to claim initial NFTs.
- How NFTs affect trading fees.
- Technical details of the smart contract for both Ethereum and BSC.

## Tests

The `tests` folder contains test scripts and automated tests for the smart contract. Ensure that the smart contract is secure and functions as expected.
